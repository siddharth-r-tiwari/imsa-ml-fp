# imsa-ml-fp

- Final project for machine learning course at IMSA; explored fundamentals of regression, supervised/unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks throughout course
- Used PCA on large dataset to demonstrate the effect of dimensionality reduction on reducing runtimes and preserving classification accuracy (using Naive Bayes)
- `TiwariQP2.ipynb` contains code for project and "TiwariQP2.pdf" contains a writeup of procedure/findings
